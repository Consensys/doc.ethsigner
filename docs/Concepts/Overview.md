# Overview

EthSigner acts as a proxy service by forwarding requests to the Ethereum client. When EthSigner receives a transaction it generates a signature using the stored private key, and forwards the signed transaction to the Ethereum client.

EthSigner can sign transactions with keys stored in:

- A [V3 keystore file](../Tutorials/Start-EthSigner.md#create-password-and-key-files) stored on a file system accessible by the host.
- [HashiCorp Vault](../HowTo/Store-Keys/Use-Hashicorp.md).
- [Azure Key Vault](../HowTo/Store-Keys/Use-Azure.md).

:::note

- The [`file-based-signer`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#file-options), [`hashicorp-signer`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#hashicorp-options), and [`azure-signer`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#azure-options) command line options are used for a [single key only](../Tutorials/Start-EthSigner.md).
- The [`multikey-signer`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#multikey-options) command line option is used for [one or more keys](../Tutorials/Multifile.md).

The transaction process when using EthSigner is:

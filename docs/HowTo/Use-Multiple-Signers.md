# Use multiple signing keys

EthSigner supports transaction signing using [multiple stored keys](../Tutorials/Multifile.md).
Any account submitting transactions to EthSigner can use the stored keys. The keys can be stored
in:

* A [V3 keystore file](../Tutorials/Multifile.md##create-password-and-key-files)
  stored on a file system accessible by the host.
* A [HashiCorp Vault](../HowTo/Store-Keys/Use-Hashicorp.md).
* An [Azure Key Vault](../HowTo/Store-Keys/Use-Azure.md).

!!! caution

    The ability to use mulitiple signing keys should be limited to the accounts with access to the
    stored keys.

Each key requires a separate [TOML file](../Reference/Multikey-Parameters.md) that defines the
parameters to access the key. The TOML files must be placed in a single directory specified using
the [`multikey-signer --directory`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#multikey-options) subcommand.

!!! tip

    Files can be added or removed from the directory without needing to restart EthSigner.

The TOML file name must use the format `[<prefix>]<accountAddress>.toml`. The account address must
be in lowercase. The prefix can be anything you want. No two TOML files can have the same key
address in the file name, even if the prefix differs.

Remove the `0x` portion of the account address. For example,
`78e6e236592597c09d5c137c2af40aecd42d12a2.toml`.

!!! tip

    Use the
    [`export-address`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Subcommands/#export-address)
    Hyperledger Besu subcommand to obtain the account address of the node.
